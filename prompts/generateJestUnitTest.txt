I will give you the node.js code for a function `{{{functionName}}}` along with other functions that are related to it, and you need to write as many automated unit tests as you can think of in Jest for `{{{functionName}}}`.

When you need to require `{{{functionName}}}`, you can require it with `const { {{{functionName}}} } = require('{{{pathRelativeToTest}}}')`. Here are paths to each of the other files (in case you need to require them):
```
{{#each relatedCode}}
require('{{{this.fileName}}}') -> require('{{{this.pathRelativeToTest}}}');
{{/each}}
```
You don't need to require each of these files but only the ones that you need.

Make sure to wrap then entire code in `describe` block because the tests you return will be merged with other tests and put into a single file.

If you need to initialize a class, make sure that you check how the constructor looks like so that you can initilize it properly.

Here is the code for the function `{{{functionName}}}`:
```javascript
{{{functionCode}}}
```

{{#each relatedCode}}
The file `{{{this.fileName}}}` contains the following code:
```javascript
{{{this.code}}}
```
{{/each}}
