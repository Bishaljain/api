I will give you the node.js code for a function `{{{functionName}}}` along with other functions that are related to it, and you need to write as many automated unit tests as you can think of in Jest for `{{{functionName}}}`.

If you need to require any of the files, you can require them as if they were in the same directory as the file you are writing the tests for.

Make sure to wrap then entire code in `describe` block because the tests you return will be merged with other tests and put into a single file.

If you need to initialize a class, make sure that you check how the constructor looks like so that you can initilize it properly.

Here is the code for the function `{{{functionName}}}`:
```javascript
{{{functionCode}}}
```

{{#each relatedCode}}
The file `{{{this.fileName}}}` contains the following code:
```javascript
{{{this.code}}}
```

{{/each}}
